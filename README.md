- ğŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Tony
- ğŸ‘€ I am interested in software development
- ğŸŒ±Currently I am learning a little about all languages (python, java, javascript, html and c++)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started learning software development because as a child I was interested in knowing how they make programs, web pages, among other things.
